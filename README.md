## DevmentorLive #0001

Your boss comes to you and they say, "So...... we have a couple thousands rows of customer data and we need to be able to display it in a table, and the table columns should be determined by the data itself, so no hard coding! Oh, and we would like to be able to sort in up and down on any column and also filter by any column."

And you say, "This is React, that's easy!"
